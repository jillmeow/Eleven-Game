##Team Blade

Team Blade consists of Nick Lorimer, Sam Gabbusch, Jill Mirandilla, and Joshua Hii.

##Introduction

Eleven is a classic platform style game, with an original twist. It tells the story
of an 11, a couple consisting of two “1’s” that has been separated by the evil Doctor Zero. The player must navigate a series of levels in order to complete the game. What makes it unique is the light and dark mechanic, and the cartoon based art style. This game was developed as an assignment for the paper COSC360 at the University of Otago at the beginning of 2015.

The light and dark mechanic works as follows:
Time spent in either a light or dark area increases the visibility in that zone, whilst decreasing  visibility in the opposite zone type. The player may gain an advantage from moving at a fast pace in order to maintain a balance of visibility between zones.

##Controls

Movement - LEFT and RIGHT arrow keys are used to navigate the levels.
Jumping - The SPACEBAR is used for jumping and double jumping (double jump must be unlocked)
Wall Jump - This uses the LEFT and RIGHT arrow keys and SPACEBAR. It is similar to regular jumping.
